# ISAC OFDM / FDM MATLAB Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB simulation codes for an
Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system based on
OFDM and FDM waveforms.

## Folder Structure
- main/: main system scripts
- run/: simulation execution scripts
- functions/: core signal processing functions
- analysis/: result comparison and visualization

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Add all folders to path
3. Run:
   run/run_ISAC_OFDM.m
   or
   run/run_ISAC_FDM.m

## Simulation Output
- BER vs SNR curves
- Performance comparison between OFDM and FDM in ISAC systems
